# 13. Composition
# Assignment:
# Create a class Engine and a class Car. Use composition by passing an Engine object to the Car class during initialization. Access a method of the Engine class via the Car class.

class Engine:
    def __init__(self, power):
        self.power = power

    def start(self):
        print("Engine started")

class Car:
    def __init__(self, engine):
        self.engine = engine

    def start(self):
        self.engine.start()

engine = Engine(100)
car = Car(engine)


car.start()
